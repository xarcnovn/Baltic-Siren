The vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nThe tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Orion Ship Management LLP, which is related to Gatik, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Orion Ship Management were the previous managers of the vessel. Tankers operated/managed by the Indian Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to conceal the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of outdated oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS) since 2022. The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.).\r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. \r\nThe shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9319703.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nSince September 12, 2025, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Thang Long Gas Co LTD was the previous owner and manager of the tanker.\r\nrussia has created its own shadow fleet of tankers, mostly made up of older tankers, many of which have experience in operating under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI predicted that russia would use a 'ghost armada' to ensure that excess profits from oil exports flow to its Chinese partner, in particular.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance the war against Ukraine.

In June 2023, the vessel entered the port of Ust-Luga, after which it was recorded with geometric circles off the coast of Angola in August-October. This location was previously associated with the Venezuelan dark fleet trade, in which tankers give out their location in Angola to disguise their real operations in Latin America.

The vessel is suspected of anchoring the Estlink 2 submarine cable on December 25, 2024. The National Bureau of Investigation of Finland is conducting criminal proceedings on suspicion of committing an aggravated crime. According to the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, the Eagle S was dragging its anchor along the seabed in the area where the Estlink 2 submarine cable was damaged. After the vessel was detained, it was discovered that the tanker had no anchor. On January 07, 2025, the anchor was raised by the Swedish ship HMS Belos. According to the Finnish transport and communications agency Traficom, the tanker Eagle S is unseaworthy - after state port control, 32 faults were found on the vessel, three of which were critical: fire safety violations, malfunctioning navigation equipment and ventilation problems in the pump room.\r\nAccording to the British publication Lloyd's List, in a series of confidential documents about the Eagle S obtained in June 2024, the Eagle S and the related sanctioned tanker Swiftsea Rider (IMO 9318539) 'were equipped with listening and receiving devices to monitor NATO naval vessels and aircraft'. The spy equipment was installed on board the Eagle S in large portable suitcases (including laptops with keyboards in russian and Turkish to make calls to Turkey and russia) and was used to monitor radio frequencies, record NATO messages and transmit the collected data to the russian authorities. Similar systems were present on the Swiftsea Rider tanker. According to the Lloyd's List source, the equipment was stored on the bridge or on the 'monkey island' (the highest place on the ship), operated by russian, Turkish, and Indian officers, and the devices were unloaded for analysis upon arrival in russia. Also, according to a Lloyd's List source, an unauthorized person was identified on board the Eagle S who was not a member of the ship's crew.\r\nThe Eagle S and Swiftsea Rider tankers are linked to the same shadowy network created in the interests of the sanctioned russian Lukoil, when, in the face of sanctions on russian oil, more than 20 tankers were purchased in 2022-2023 and transferred under bareboat charter to Eiger Shipping by the shipping division of the russian oil trader Litasco, affiliated with Lukoil. According to the Financial Times investigation, the purchased tankers were transferred under the Cook Islands flag and under the management of sanctioned Dubai companies - Radiating World Shipping (16 vessels) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (6 vessels).\r\nAccording to the British publication Lloyd's List, the tanker Eagle S is one of dozens of shadow tankers involved in the russian oil/oil products trade, and is affiliated with the Indian company Peninsular Maritime India PVT, which is affiliated with two sanctioned companies Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE). Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE) are considered to be the leading shadow fleet operators that played a key role in the export of russian oil/oil products under sanctions in 2022-2023. After the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE) in December 2023, the companies ceased operations and transferred their fleets to related companies, including Peninsular Maritime India. \r\nDespite the fact that the shipowner and commercial manager of the tanker Eagle S is Caravella LLC-FZ, based in the UAE, the ISM manager of the vessel is the Indian company Peninsular Maritime India PVT, according to the website of the Indian company Uniocean Marine Services, the Eagle S belonged to its fleet, but after Finland arrested the tanker for damaging the Estlink 2 submarine cable, information about the Eagle S in the Uniocean Marine Services fleet was removed from the company's website. At the same time, the website states that the company's fleet includes a number of sanctioned tankers affiliated with the sanctioned shadow fleet operators Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE).\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 03, 2024, USA imposed sanctions on the tanker.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance its war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance its war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Until 2023, the tanker was not involved in the transportation of russian oil.\r\nThe international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian crude around the world and threaten the environment.\r\nThe ISM management of the vessel in 2023-2024 was carried out by the Indian company Margao Marine Solutions OPC. The said company carried out ISM management of another sanctioned shadow fleet tanker IMO 9402471, which was involved in a collision near Denmark when the tanker was sailing to load russian flagship Urals crude oil on March 04, 2024 in the Baltic port of Primorsk. This incident is an indication of the risks associated with the activities of the outdated shadow tanker fleet at sea.\r\nToday, russia continues to make efforts to avoid/ circumvent sanctions, expand its shadow fleet with a growing number of outdated, poorly maintained vessels, use a 'ghost armada', many of which have experience in working under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran and Venezuela, use 'convenient' flags for vessel registration, complex ownership and management structures, and employ various tactics to conceal the origin of their cargo, including ship-to-shore transshipment (STS), disabling automatic identification systems (AIS), falsifying positions, transmitting false data, and other deceptive or even illegal methods. russia's shadow fleet, operating with minimal compliance with the rules and transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOn December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country.\r\nOn February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn June 19, 2025, New Zealand imposed sanctions on the vessel."

In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels that are involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.).\r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9378620.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

The tanker 'CORUS' is certified by the Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nIn 2024, the tanker transported russian oil from the port of Primorsk to India. The shipments were carried out under the command of captain Konstantin Kovalenko.\r\nThe tanker is managed by Prominent Shipmanagement LTD, established in 2022 in Hong Kong, which was sanctioned by USA on January 10, 2025. Prominent is headed by Arjun Deshmukh, who worked for FESCO Wallem Shipmanagement, a joint venture between a russian company and Hong Kong's oldest ship manager. Prominent Shipmanagement LTD took over all tankers operated by K&O Shipmanagement FZE, a Dubai-based company affiliated with the sanctioned russian company Sovcomflot, and the vessels were included in the Indian Register of Shipping (the classification society with the largest market share of the so-called shadow fleet).\r\nPJSC Sovcomflot is the largest state-owned shipping company in russia, a key company for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas amidst the sanctions restrictions imposed on russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The services provided by Sovcomflot are a significant source of income for russia, as more than 70% of russia's revenues come from energy sales, which allows it to finance its war against Ukraine. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. \"Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to experts, the tankers 're-registered' by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas under western sanctions.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance the war against Ukraine.

In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under \"convenient flags\", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nThe shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country.\r\nOn February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Gatik Ship Management has become the largest carrier of russian oil since the beginning of the full-scale war against Ukraine. The company was used to operate russia's \"shadow fleet\" of oil transport, and the British regulator Lloyd's Register has withdrawn the certification of 21 of the company's vessels. A major insurance company, American Club (USA), also announced that it no longer provides coverage for Gatik vessels. \r\nIn June 2024, EU imposed sanctions on the vessel due to its involvement in the transportation of russian oil and/or oil products from russia to third countries, as well as its participation in the circumvention of european restrictions.\r\nOn October 17, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in response to the transportation of oil/oil products originating from russia or exported from russia, using irregular and high-risk shipping practices, as specified in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."
