The vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nThe tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Orion Ship Management LLP, which is related to Gatik, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions. Gatik Ship Management and Orion Ship Management were the previous managers of the vessel. Tankers operated/managed by the Indian Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to conceal the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of outdated oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS) since 2022. The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.).\r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. \r\nThe shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9319703.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nSince September 12, 2025, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Thang Long Gas Co LTD was the previous owner and manager of the tanker.\r\nrussia has created its own shadow fleet of tankers, mostly made up of older tankers, many of which have experience in operating under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI predicted that russia would use a 'ghost armada' to ensure that excess profits from oil exports flow to its Chinese partner, in particular.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance the war against Ukraine.

In June 2023, the vessel entered the port of Ust-Luga, after which it was recorded with geometric circles off the coast of Angola in August-October. This location was previously associated with the Venezuelan dark fleet trade, in which tankers give out their location in Angola to disguise their real operations in Latin America.

The vessel is suspected of anchoring the Estlink 2 submarine cable on December 25, 2024. The National Bureau of Investigation of Finland is conducting criminal proceedings on suspicion of committing an aggravated crime. According to the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, the Eagle S was dragging its anchor along the seabed in the area where the Estlink 2 submarine cable was damaged. After the vessel was detained, it was discovered that the tanker had no anchor. On January 07, 2025, the anchor was raised by the Swedish ship HMS Belos. According to the Finnish transport and communications agency Traficom, the tanker Eagle S is unseaworthy - after state port control, 32 faults were found on the vessel, three of which were critical: fire safety violations, malfunctioning navigation equipment and ventilation problems in the pump room.\r\nAccording to the British publication Lloyd's List, in a series of confidential documents about the Eagle S obtained in June 2024, the Eagle S and the related sanctioned tanker Swiftsea Rider (IMO 9318539) 'were equipped with listening and receiving devices to monitor NATO naval vessels and aircraft'. The spy equipment was installed on board the Eagle S in large portable suitcases (including laptops with keyboards in russian and Turkish to make calls to Turkey and russia) and was used to monitor radio frequencies, record NATO messages and transmit the collected data to the russian authorities. Similar systems were present on the Swiftsea Rider tanker. According to the Lloyd's List source, the equipment was stored on the bridge or on the 'monkey island' (the highest place on the ship), operated by russian, Turkish, and Indian officers, and the devices were unloaded for analysis upon arrival in russia. Also, according to a Lloyd's List source, an unauthorized person was identified on board the Eagle S who was not a member of the ship's crew.\r\nThe Eagle S and Swiftsea Rider tankers are linked to the same shadowy network created in the interests of the sanctioned russian Lukoil, when, in the face of sanctions on russian oil, more than 20 tankers were purchased in 2022-2023 and transferred under bareboat charter to Eiger Shipping by the shipping division of the russian oil trader Litasco, affiliated with Lukoil. According to the Financial Times investigation, the purchased tankers were transferred under the Cook Islands flag and under the management of sanctioned Dubai companies - Radiating World Shipping (16 vessels) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (6 vessels).\r\nAccording to the British publication Lloyd's List, the tanker Eagle S is one of dozens of shadow tankers involved in the russian oil/oil products trade, and is affiliated with the Indian company Peninsular Maritime India PVT, which is affiliated with two sanctioned companies Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE). Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE) are considered to be the leading shadow fleet operators that played a key role in the export of russian oil/oil products under sanctions in 2022-2023. After the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE) in December 2023, the companies ceased operations and transferred their fleets to related companies, including Peninsular Maritime India. \r\nDespite the fact that the shipowner and commercial manager of the tanker Eagle S is Caravella LLC-FZ, based in the UAE, the ISM manager of the vessel is the Indian company Peninsular Maritime India PVT, according to the website of the Indian company Uniocean Marine Services, the Eagle S belonged to its fleet, but after Finland arrested the tanker for damaging the Estlink 2 submarine cable, information about the Eagle S in the Uniocean Marine Services fleet was removed from the company's website. At the same time, the website states that the company's fleet includes a number of sanctioned tankers affiliated with the sanctioned shadow fleet operators Radiating World Shipping Services (UAE) and Star Voyages Shipping Services (UAE).\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 03, 2024, USA imposed sanctions on the tanker.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance its war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance its war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 16, 2024, the EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\nOn July 21, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Until 2023, the tanker was not involved in the transportation of russian oil.\r\nThe international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of a shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian crude around the world and threaten the environment.\r\nThe ISM management of the vessel in 2023-2024 was carried out by the Indian company Margao Marine Solutions OPC. The said company carried out ISM management of another sanctioned shadow fleet tanker IMO 9402471, which was involved in a collision near Denmark when the tanker was sailing to load russian flagship Urals crude oil on March 04, 2024 in the Baltic port of Primorsk. This incident is an indication of the risks associated with the activities of the outdated shadow tanker fleet at sea.\r\nToday, russia continues to make efforts to avoid/ circumvent sanctions, expand its shadow fleet with a growing number of outdated, poorly maintained vessels, use a 'ghost armada', many of which have experience in working under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran and Venezuela, use 'convenient' flags for vessel registration, complex ownership and management structures, and employ various tactics to conceal the origin of their cargo, including ship-to-shore transshipment (STS), disabling automatic identification systems (AIS), falsifying positions, transmitting false data, and other deceptive or even illegal methods. russia's shadow fleet, operating with minimal compliance with the rules and transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOn December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country.\r\nOn February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33); promoting or supporting actions/policies aimed at the exploitation, development or expansion of the energy sector in russia, including energy infrastructure (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn June 19, 2025, New Zealand imposed sanctions on the vessel."

In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels that are involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.).\r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9378620.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

The tanker 'CORUS' is certified by the Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nIn 2024, the tanker transported russian oil from the port of Primorsk to India. The shipments were carried out under the command of captain Konstantin Kovalenko.\r\nThe tanker is managed by Prominent Shipmanagement LTD, established in 2022 in Hong Kong, which was sanctioned by USA on January 10, 2025. Prominent is headed by Arjun Deshmukh, who worked for FESCO Wallem Shipmanagement, a joint venture between a russian company and Hong Kong's oldest ship manager. Prominent Shipmanagement LTD took over all tankers operated by K&O Shipmanagement FZE, a Dubai-based company affiliated with the sanctioned russian company Sovcomflot, and the vessels were included in the Indian Register of Shipping (the classification society with the largest market share of the so-called shadow fleet).\r\nPJSC Sovcomflot is the largest state-owned shipping company in russia, a key company for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas amidst the sanctions restrictions imposed on russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The services provided by Sovcomflot are a significant source of income for russia, as more than 70% of russia's revenues come from energy sales, which allows it to finance its war against Ukraine. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. \"Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to experts, the tankers 're-registered' by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas under western sanctions.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance the war against Ukraine.

In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under \"convenient flags\", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nThe shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn December 17, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a vessel in connection with the transportation of oil or oil products originating in russia or from russia to a third country.\r\nOn February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Until 2023, the tanker was not involved in the transportation of russian oil. Since February 2024, the vessel has been certified by the Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nOil exports are ussia's largest source of revenue. From February 2022 to June 2024, russia earned 475 billion euros in oil export revenues (68% of all fossil fuel export revenues). In 2023, about a third of all tax revenues in russia came from the sale of oil and gas. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by 'shadow' tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries implementing price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nToday, russia continues to make efforts to avoid/ circumvent sanctions, expand its shadow fleet with a growing number of outdated, poorly maintained vessels, use a 'ghost armada', many of which have experience in working under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran and Venezuela, use 'convenient' flags for vessel registration, complex ownership and management structures, and employ various tactics to conceal the origin of their cargo, including ship-to-shore transshipment (STS), disabling automatic identification systems (AIS), falsifying positions, transmitting false data, and other deceptive or even illegal methods. russia's shadow fleet, operating with minimal compliance with the rules and transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

The tanker 'CORUS' is certified by the Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nIn 2024, the tanker transported russian oil from the port of Primorsk to India. The shipments were carried out under the command of captain Konstantin Kovalenko.\r\nThe tanker is managed by Prominent Shipmanagement LTD, established in 2022 in Hong Kong, which was sanctioned by USA on January 10, 2025. Prominent is headed by Arjun Deshmukh, who worked for FESCO Wallem Shipmanagement, a joint venture between a russian company and Hong Kong's oldest ship manager. Prominent Shipmanagement LTD took over all tankers operated by K&O Shipmanagement FZE, a Dubai-based company affiliated with the sanctioned russian company Sovcomflot, and the vessels were included in the Indian Register of Shipping (the classification society with the largest market share of the so-called shadow fleet).\r\nPJSC Sovcomflot is the largest state-owned shipping company in russia, a key company for servicing and supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, transportation of russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas amidst the sanctions restrictions imposed on russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The services provided by Sovcomflot are a significant source of income for russia, as more than 70% of russia's revenues come from energy sales, which allows it to finance its war against Ukraine. The main charterers of Sovcomflot vessels are the largest oil and gas companies and traders in russia. \"Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', 'Sakhalin-2', 'Varandey', 'Prirazlomnoye', 'Novy Port', 'Yamal LNG' and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly 'juggling' (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to experts, the tankers 're-registered' by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called 'shadow tanker fleet' of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas under western sanctions.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance the war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin by circumventing sanctions by disguising its activities under third-country flags, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental safety hazards with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequately insured shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33) (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

    "vessel_information": "Vessel information\nThe tanker is involved in the export of russian oil from russian ports in the Black and Baltic seas to third countries, as well as to the EU countries, in violation of the g7 and EU oil embargo on russian oil. In particular, in August 2024, the vessel transported russian oil from the port of Tuapse ( russia) to the EU countries to the area south of the Laconian gulf, west of the island of Kithira.\r\nThe vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nThe international public organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers transporting russian oil around the world and threatening the environment.\r\nThe tanker is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the Gatik-related company Gaurik Ship Management LLP, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Orion Ship Management LLP, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels managed by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions.\r\nGatik Ship Management and Gaurik Ship Management LLP were the previous managers of the tanker 'GOLDEN MILE'.\r\nTankers operated/managed by the Indian Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports. \r\nAgainst the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to conceal the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures.

Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.). \r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The recent incidents off Malaysia only underscore the need for swift action to curb the potentially devastating impact of the growing 'shadow fleet'. 'Shadow' tankers have already been involved in 50 incidents from the Danish Straits all the way to Malaysia since russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\r\nAccording to CREA, from January to August 2024, the number of shadow tankers crossing the Danish Straits in Europe increased by 277% compared to the same period in 2022, with 64% of the 46 million tons of russian marine oil transported through the Danish Straits being transported by shadow tankers. In the same period, the number of shadow tankers in the Straits of Dover and Gibraltar increased by 355% compared to 2022, transporting 67% of the 37 million tons of oil through the straits. The Suez Canal experienced a staggering 649% increase in shadow tanker traffic, with 69% of the 52 million tons of russian crude oil passing through it being transported by these vessels.\r\nThus, the 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9337901.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nIn June 2025, Australia imposed sanctions on the vessel."

As a result, the russian Surgutneftegaz earned about $1.4 billion bypassing the price ceiling. At the same time, tankers registered to Lagosmarine Ltd, which is affiliated with Sparta Shipmanagement Limited through a joint director, are constantly making voyages between the russian ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga, Kozmino and India and China. According to customs documents, the same routes were used to move oil sold to Dubai companies linked to Halsavins. \r\nThe Israeli Ministry of Defense accuses one of Lagosmarine's tankers, ІМО 9235725, in transporting Iranian oil for the Quds Force and Hezbollah.\r\nAccording to the United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), the vessel ІМО 9282792 was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and since January 2022 has switched to transporting russian oil. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 100 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products.\r\nIn his LinkedIn profile, Haliavins lists himself as a beneficiary and CEO of Conrad Management Company, which is listed as a sponsor company in the UAE residence permits of employees of the russian state-owned company JSC Foreign Economic Association Promsyryoimport (TIN 9704027750, sanctioned by USA and Ukraine). This russian company is involved in schemes to supply Iranian oil to Syria and the TOT of Crimea.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nAccording to the database of the Global Integrated Shipping Information System of the International Maritime Organization (IMO's GISIS) as of July 28, 2025, the vessel's registered name is AQUA LIVE, the flag is indicated as \"Aruba False\"."

The services provided by PJSC Sovcomflot are a significant source of income for russia, as more than 70% of russia's revenues come from energy sales, which allows it to finance its war against Ukraine. The main charterers of Sovcomflot's vessels are russia's largest oil and gas companies and traders. Sovcomflot is involved in servicing major oil and gas projects in russia: 'Sakhalin-1', ‘Sakhalin-2’, ‘Varandey’, ‘Prirazlomnoye’, ‘Novy Port’, ‘Yamal LNG’ and others. Prior to russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the company's fleet consisted of about 145 vessels. After the sanctions were imposed, Sovcomflot transferred dozens of vessels to the ownership of companies it had set up, including in foreign jurisdictions, in order to circumvent them, and began the practice of constantly ‘juggling’ (transferring) vessels to related companies. According to experts, the tankers ‘re-registered’ by Sovcomflot to related companies are part of the so-called ‘shadow tanker fleet’ of the russian federation to continue selling russian oil, oil products, and liquefied gas under western sanctions. \r\nAccording to the American human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors tanker traffic related to Iran using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel."

In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nThe shadow fleet of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel."

Until 2022, the tanker was not involved in the transportation of russian oil. The vessel is certified by the China Classification Society (IACS).\r\nOil exports are ussia's largest source of revenue. From February 2022 to June 2024, russia earned 475 billion euros in oil export revenues (68% of all fossil fuel export revenues). In 2023, about a third of all tax revenues in russia came from the sale of oil and gas. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by 'shadow' tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries implementing price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nToday, russia continues to make efforts to avoid/ circumvent sanctions, expand its shadow fleet with a growing number of outdated, poorly maintained vessels, use a 'ghost armada', many of which have experience in working under sanctions imposed on regimes such as Iran and Venezuela, use 'convenient' flags for vessel registration, complex ownership and management structures, and employ various tactics to conceal the origin of their cargo, including ship-to-shore transshipment (STS), disabling automatic identification systems (AIS), falsifying positions, transmitting false data, and other deceptive or even illegal methods. russia's shadow fleet, operating with minimal compliance with the rules and transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force.\r\nIn June 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel."

The Israeli Ministry of Defense accuses the tanker ІМО 9235725 of transporting Iranian oil for the Quds Force and Hezbollah.\r\nThe international NGO Greenpeace refers to the tanker as part of the shadow fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment.\r\nThe tanker is affiliated with the Cypriot company Lagosmarine Ltd (НE 402876) as the former manager of the vessel. The company's director is Δακης Μαυρουδης, who, in turn, is a director of another Cypriot company, Sparta Shipmanagement Limited (ΗΕ 393698).

In January-May 2024, only Black Pearl Energy Trading bought oil from the russian company, purchasing more than 20.6 million barrels at $83.7. As a result, the russian Surgutneftegaz earned about $1.4 billion bypassing the price ceiling. At the same time, tankers registered to Lagosmarine Ltd, which is affiliated with Sparta Shipmanagement Limited through a joint director, are constantly making voyages between the russian ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga, Kozmino and India and China. According to customs documents, the same routes were used to move oil sold to Dubai companies linked to Haliavins. \r\nIn his LinkedIn profile, Haliavins lists himself as a beneficiary and CEO of Conrad Management Company, which is listed as a sponsor company in the UAE residence permits of employees of the russian state-owned company JSC Foreign Economic Association Promsyryoimport (TIN 9704027750, sanctioned by USA and Ukraine).

In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels.

    "vessel_information": "Vessel information\nSince July 2024, the tanker, which does not have proper insurance from the International P&I Club, has been focused on transshipment in the area of Greece and Cyprus by making STS transfers of russian wet cargo mainly from the russian ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk, as well as from the Taman crude oil/petroleum products transshipment complex, Primorsk and Ust-Luga. Such deliveries from russian ports for further transshipment in European waters are carried out by a number of tankers, in particular, affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the largest operators of the russian shadow fleet, which in 2022-2023 played a key role in the export of russian crude oil/petroleum products under Western sanctions.\r\nTransshipment of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin at sea using the STS method allows to conceal ownership and origin of the cargo, and legalize their supply to the EU, USA and other countries. In turn, the sale of crude oil/petroleum products on the world market allows accumulating significant financial resources in the state budget of the russian federation, which are used, among other things, to build up the military potential of the aggressor state and to provide material support for russia's military operations on the territory of Ukraine.\r\nThe first STS transmission since July 2024 in the Gulf of Laconikos took place on July 23, 2024 with the tanker IMO 9412177, which arrived in the area near Greece from the russian port of Primorsk. \r\nSubsequent STS transmissions with russian affiliation took place in the area near Greece:\r\nJuly 31, 2024 with tanker IMO 9340116, which arrived from the russian port of Tuapse;\r\nAugust 02, 2024 with tanker IMO 9374416, which arrived from the russian port of Tuapse;\r\nonAugust 09, 2024 with the tanker IMO 9315757, which arrived from the Taman crude oil/petroleum products transshipment complex;\r\non August 12, 2024 with the tanker IMO 9263203, which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\non August 14, 2024 with the tanker IMO 9228784, which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\nOn August 17, 2024, with the tanker IMO 9260067 (under USA sanctions since October 17, 2024), which arrived from the ports of Gelendzhik and Tuapse;\r\non August 19, 2024, with the tanker IMO 9278698, which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\nOnAugust 28, 2024, with the tanker IMO 9263186, which arrived from the ports of Gelendzhik and Novorossiysk;\r\non August 29, 2024, with the tanker IMO 9318034 (affiliated with the shadow operator Gatik Ship Management), which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\non September 15, 2024, with the tanker IMO 9251456, which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\non October 17, November 15, December 08, 2024, January 06, 2025 with the tanker IMO 9234501, which arrived from the Taman crude oil/petroleum products transshipment complex and the port of Novorossiysk;\r\nOn November 03 and 29, 2024, with tanker IMO 9327372 (under sanctions of the EU, Switzerland, the United Kingdom), which is affiliated with the shadow operator Gatik Ship Management and arrived from the ports of Tuapse and Gelendzhik;\r\non November 13 and 26, 2024, with the tanker IMO 9353096 (under sanctions of the United Kingdom, Canada, the EU, Switzerland), which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\non December 05, 2024 with the tanker IMO 9266475 (under sanctions of the United Kingdom, EU, Switzerland), which arrived from the Taman crude oil/petroleum products transshipment complex;\r\non December 17, 2024 with the tanker IMO 9299862 (affiliated with the shadow operator Gatik Ship Management), which arrived from the port of Tuapse;\r\nin December 2024, January 2025 with the tanker IMO 9272931 (affiliated with the Indian company Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment, which was one of the ten companies that participated in the juggling of vessels from the Gatik Ship Management fleet).\r\nAt the same time, there were STS transfers in the area of Greece with other tankers affiliated with Gatik Ship Management, namely IMO 9299123 (in September, October, November 2024); IMO 9352195 (in September and December 2024); repeated transfers with IMO 9253234.\r\nAfter STS transfers with IMO tanker 9247443, which acts as an STS hub for transshipment of russian crude oil/petroleum products, some of these tankers head to Libyan ports, in particular, Benghazi, which has no refineries and no direct connection to Libyan oil wells. According to the international NGO Greenpeace, some of the fuel imported by Libya, which is subject to the subsidy program, is loaded into large tanker trucks that transport it to small old tankers waiting in the old port. The vessels then leave the port with fake certificates and disabled AIS transmitters to smuggle the fuel at market price. This is the way to illegally trade in russian crude oil/oil products.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU imposed sanctions, which will enter into force on May 21, 2025, on the tanker for the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force."

In particular, in May 2024, the vessel was transporting russian crude oil from the port of Primorsk in the Baltic Sea to the place of oil transfer near the port of Nador (Morocco) and the Spanish port of Melilla. \r\nAccording to the USA-based human rights group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic using satellite data, the vessel was involved in the transportation of Iranian oil and switched to transporting russian oil on August 31, 2023. Since the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian oil/oil products.

From February 2022 to November 22, 2024, russia earned almost 546 billion euros in oil export revenues (69% of all fossil fuel export revenues). In 2023, about a third of all tax revenues in russia came from the sale of oil and gas. The tax on oil production collected by the russian federation in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to the CREA data for October 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 210 million euros per day, 83% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by shadow tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 17% of the total value of russian oil exported in October.\r\nShadow fleet of russia continues to generate multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn May 20, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country.\r\nOn June 03, 2025, the sanctions imposed by Switzerland on the vessel came into force."

    "vessel_information": "Vessel information\nThe tanker during the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price cap policy on russian crude oil/petroleum products is involved in the export of russian crude oil/petroleum products, and resorts to deceptive, high-risk practices (disabling AIS, conducting dark activities near Malaysia, making STS transmissions with russian affiliation).\r\nIn early January 2023, the tanker IMO 9422988 made an STS transmission in international waters of the South Korean anchorage with the help of the russian tanker IMO 9301407 (under sanctions since January 2025, affiliated with the sanctioned russian company PJSC Sovcomflot), which had previously been loaded at the russian oil terminal De-Kastri.\r\nThe tanker IMO 9422988 is involved in an established chain of supply of russian crude oil/petroleum products to third countries by making STS transfers in the area near European countries, in particular, with the sanctioned tanker IMO 9247443, which since July 2024 has been operating in the area near Greece, Cyprus as a transshipment STS hub for russian crude oil/petroleum products, which are transported by tankers mainly from the russian ports of Tuapse, Novorossiysk, Taman crude oil/petroleum products transshipment complex for transshipment near European countries. In January and March 2025, tanker IMO 9422988 conducted STS transmissions with tanker IMO 9247443 near Greece and Cyprus, respectively. There are other STS transfers near Cyprus and Greece in 2025 with other tankers of the russian shadow fleet (IMO 9352195, IMO 9314882, IMO 9263203, IMO 9299862, IMO 9198290, IMO 9424651), which were sanctioned by the EU, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom in May 2025.\r\nTransshipment of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin by STS method at sea allows concealing the ownership and origin of the cargo, legalizing their supply to the EU, USA and other countries. In turn, the sale of crude oil/petroleum products on the world market allows the russian state budget to accumulate significant financial resources, which are used, among other things, to build up the military potential of the aggressor state and to provide material support for russia's military operations on the territory of Ukraine. \r\nThe tanker is involved in the transportation of Iranian oil to Chinese refineries, for which it was sanctioned by USAA in March 2025.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the shadow fleet of the russian federation, including for engaging in activities aimed at destabilizing Ukraine, undermining/threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine or benefiting from or supporting the government of russia, and participating in the transportation of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin, in particular, from russia to a third country."

Fractal Marine DMCC operated a fleet of 28 tankers as an intermediary between ship owners and charterers. \r\nOn February 22, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Fractal Marine DMCC in connection with its involvement in servicing the russian energy sector.\r\nFractal Marine DMCC, together with Gatik Ship Management (India) and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC (UAE, under UK sanctions), are considered the leading operators of the russian shadow fleet, which in early 2023 assembled a fleet of about 90 tankers, 90% of which transported russian oil/oil products from the Baltic and Black Sea ports of russia to India, China, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America. In less than a year, the $2 billion fleet of oil tankers assembled by Fractal and Gatik could transport more than 40 million barrels of oil/oil products. Fractal Marine DMCC, Gatik Ship Management and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC in the tanker market helped russian oil continue to circulate around the world and the russian government to generate multibillion-dollar revenues bypassing the sanctions.\r\nAfter Fractal Marine was sanctioned, DMCC tried to challenge the sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom but lost in court. After that, the company 're-signed' its fleet to other companies.\r\nOn February 24, March 04, 2025 EU and Switzerland respectively imposed sanctions on the tanker for transporting crude oil/oil products originating in or exported from russia using irregular and high-risk shipping practices as specified in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly resolution A.1192 (33) (EU sanctions will enter into force on February 25, 2025).\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9282493.\r\nOn May 09, 2025, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on the tanker as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet.\r\nAccording to GISIS IMO data as of July 15, 2025, the vessel's registration name is ASTERI, and the flag is designated as \"Sint Maarten False\"."

    "vessel_information": "Vessel information\nIn 2024, the tanker is involved in the export of russian oil to China from the russian ports of the Pacific region Kozmino and Nakhodka.\r\nThe international non-governmental organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment.\r\nAccording to Lloyd's List, the tanker is linked to anonymous Chinese buyers who spent about $376 million to purchase 13 tankers to carry out risky ship-to-ship transportation of russian oil in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Ship-to-shore logistics hubs are a common feature of the scheme, allowing for the concealment of ownership and origin of cargo. In addition to the mid-Atlantic STS hub, there are also areas near the ports of Kalamata (Greece), Malta, Ceuta, and the Caucasus where ship-to-ship operations have been established for russian oil. STS's operations in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are outside the jurisdiction of port authorities, with limited technical and operational oversight, which increases safety and environmental concerns due to the unknown insurance and vessel ownership data.\r\nLloyd's List has tracked five Aframax tankers, seven large oil carriers and one Suezmax vessel to an anonymous buyer through separate but related companies operating offshore Hong Kong and China that own similar vessels. The group of tankers was acquired between May and July 2022 for a total of $285 million, based on ship brokerage reports and market valuations. Since then, all but one of the tankers have been involved in the transshipment of russian oil cargoes at a high-risk transshipment hub located 860 nautical miles west of Portugal in international waters. The vessels purchased by the anonymous Chinese buyer are 15 years old or more, making it impossible for most major oil companies to charter them and impossible to obtain conventional financing.\r\nUnder the sanctions, russia has begun to build up its own shadow fleet of outdated tankers, which has no 'ties' with the G7 and the EU and can transport oil in violation of price caps. russia disguises its shadow activities at sea under the 'convenient' flags of third countries, operates at sea without proper insurance from the international club of insurers, uses complex schemes to conceal the owners of the shadow fleet, uses various deceptive tactics to conceal the origin of its cargo, creates threats to environmental safety with large-scale economic costs for coastal countries due to the growing threat of oil spills, does not use pilots to navigate difficult areas, etc.\r\nrussia's 'shadow fleet' continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn November 25, 2024, United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian oil/oil products from the russian federation to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet.\r\nOn December 16, 2024, EU imposed sanctions on the tanker (effective from December 17, 2024) due to the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular high-risk shipping practices as set out in the International Maritime Organization General Assembly Resolution A.1192(33).\r\nOn December 23, 2024, Switzerland imposed sanctions on the vessel in connection with the transportation of crude oil or petroleum products originating in or exported from russia, using irregular and risky shipping practices, as set out in the resolution of the General Assembly of the International Maritime Organization A.1192(33).\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on a vessel considered to be part of the shadow fleet.\r\nOn February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel."

    "vessel_information": "Vessel information\nDuring the period of the G7 and EU oil embargo and the price-cap policy on russian oil, the tanker is involved in the export of russian oil from russian ports to third countries, and resorts to the practice of turning off the AIS signal, conducting so-called 'dark activities' at sea.\r\nThe international non-governmental organization Greenpeace refers to the tanker as a shadowy fleet of tankers that transport russian oil around the world and threaten the environment.\r\nThe owner, manager and commercial manager of the tanker is an unknown company Tagabo Maritime Corp. (Seychelles), and the ISM manager is the Indian company Pinaka Ship Management. The fleet of the shipowner and the commercial manager of the vessel consists only of the tanker ІМО 9274434.\r\nThe vessel is certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS).\r\nThe tanker ІМО 9274434 is affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called 'shadow' fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil under Western sanctions, and the company Orion Ship Management LLP, which is related to Gatik, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management LLP, Geras Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Nautilus Shipping (India), Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment LLC, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to 'juggle' vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management to avoid sanctions.\r\nGatik Ship Management and Orion Ship Management were the previous managers of the tanker ІМО 9274434.\r\nTankers operated/managed by India's Gatik Ship Management continue to be used by related companies and call at russian ports.\r\nAs sanctions are being imposed, russia uses a scheme of \"juggling\" ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of obsolete oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under \"convenient flags\", which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels that are involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.).\r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits close to the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with automatic identification systems disabled, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community. The recent incidents off Malaysia only underscore the need for swift action to curb the potentially devastating impact of the growing 'shadow fleet'. 'Shadow' tankers have already been involved in 50 incidents from the Danish Straits all the way to Malaysia since russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\r\nAccording to CREA, from January to August 2024, the number of shadow tankers crossing the Danish Straits in Europe increased by 277% compared to the same period in 2022, with 64% of the 46 million tons of russian marine oil transported through the Danish Straits being transported by shadow tankers. In the same period, the number of shadow tankers in the Straits of Dover and Gibraltar increased by 355% compared to 2022, transporting 67% of the 37 million tons of oil through the straits. The Suez Canal experienced a staggering 649% increase in shadow tanker traffic, with 69% of the 52 million tons of russian crude oil passing through it being transported by these vessels.\r\nThus, the 'shadow fleet' of the russian federation continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant threats to environmental safety with significant economic costs for coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers.\r\nOn November 25, 2024, the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on a tanker in connection with the transportation of russian oil/oil products from the russian federation to a third country as part of the restrictions on the russian shadow fleet.\r\nOn January 10, 2025, USA imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn February 21, 2025, Canada imposed sanctions on the vessel.\r\nOn April 11, 2025, Ukraine imposed sanctions on the master of vessel IMO 9274434."

Such deliveries from russian ports for further transshipment via tanker IMO 9247443 in European waters are carried out by a number of tankers, including those affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management. STS transmissions with tanker IMO 9247443 took place near Greece in December 2024, when tanker IMO 9272931 arrived in the Greek area from the russian port of Novorossiysk.\r\nThe IMO tanker IMO 9272931 is involved in other STS transmissions with russian affiliation. Transshipment of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin by STS method at sea allows concealing the ownership and origin of the cargo, legalizing their supply to the EU, the USA and other countries. In turn, the sale of crude oil/petroleum products on the world market allows accumulating significant financial resources in the state budget of the russian federation, which are used, among other things, to build up the military potential of the aggressor state and to provide material support for russia's military operations on the territory of Ukraine.\r\nIn March and April 2023, the tanker was involved in the export of russian oil products (more than 60 thousand tons) from the russian port of Tuapse, where the production complex belonging to the sanctioned PJSC Rosneft Oil Company, the Tuapse Oil Refinery with a sea terminal, is located. The sender of the cargo was the sanctioned russian Rosneft, the recipient was Bellatrix Energy Limited (Hong Kong), which was sanctioned by the United States in December 2023 for significant participation in the trade in russian crude oil/petroleum products after the implementation of the price restriction policy, and Blackford Corporation Limited.\r\nThe tanker is affiliated with Ark Seakonnect Shipmanagment, which in 2023, together with Caishan Ship Management, Plutos Ship Management, Gaurik Ship Management, Girik Ship Management, Galena Ship Management, Orion Ship Management, Geras Ship Management, Zidan Ship Management, was involved in a scheme to \"juggle\" vessels operated by Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the shadow fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil/petroleum products under Western sanctions."

There are also STS transmissions in the Laconikos Gulf (Greece) with the super tanker IMO 9402732, affiliated with the Indian company Gatik Ship Management, one of the leading operators of the so-called \"shadow\" fleet involved in the transportation of russian crude oil/petroleum products in 2022-2023 under Western sanctions. The super tanker IMO 9402732 carries out STS transmissions with tankers delivering russian crude oil/petroleum products, in particular from russian ports in the Black Sea. Earlier, there were STS transmissions in the Laconikos Gulf with the tanker IMO 9144782 of the shadow fleet built in 1997, which is also involved in the transportation of Iranian oil.\r\nTransshipment of crude oil/petroleum products of russian origin by STS method allows to conceal the ownership and origin of the cargo, legalize their supply to EU countries, USA and other countries. In turn, the sale of crude oil/petroleum products on the world market allows accumulating significant financial resources in the state budget of the russian federation, which are used, among other things, to build up the military potential of the aggressor state and to provide material support for russia's military operations on the territory of Ukraine."

According to UANI, the tanker was engaged in AIS signal spoofing while loading crude oil from Sirri Island (Iran) in August 2021, as well as MMSI spoofing by posing as another vessel while unloading Iranian oil in Banias (Syria) in September 2021. In particular, during the offloading of Iranian oil in Banias (Syria) in September 2021, according to AIS data, the vessel was anchored west of the Cyprus STS transmission zone, while sending AIS messages from Spain at 36.179, 5.926.\r\nSince the beginning of russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 90 vessels that previously helped Tehran export Iranian export oil are now helping russia transport russian crude oil/oil products. In May 2022, UANI first predicted that russia would turn to the 'ghost armada' to ensure oil flows to its Chinese partner.\r\nUANI also included the tanker in the list of tankers of the Maduro-Khamenei Oil Alliance involved in the transportation of Iranian and Venezuelan oil. On June 11, 2022, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and former Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi signed a 20-year cooperation agreement to expand ties in the oil and petrochemical industries, military and economic spheres. Since then, bilateral ties have been developing: in 2023, Iran supplied more than 12 million barrels of crude oil and gas condensate, and Venezuela supplied about the same amount of fuel oil to Iran in return. Most of the cargo is transported by vessels of the sanctioned National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) in both directions: Iranian oil and gas are unloaded in Venezuelan ports, and the same NITC tankers load Venezuelan fuel oil on the way back to China. A significant number of non-NITC vessels flying foreign (not Iranian) flags are also involved in the trade."

The shipping company Fractal Marine DMCC (UAE) was established by former Socar CEO Mathieu Philippe as a subsidiary of the Swiss Fractal Shipping SA shortly before the G7 countries introduced a price-cap policy on russian oil after russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and played a significant role in the transportation of russian oil. On February 22, 2024, United Kingdom imposed sanctions on Fractal Marine DMCC in connection with its involvement in servicing the russian energy sector. Fractal Marine DMCC operated a fleet of 28 tankers as an intermediary between ship owners and charterers. Fractal Marine DMCC, together with Gatik Ship Management (India) and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC (UAE, under UK sanctions), are considered the leading operators of the russian shadow fleet, which in early 2023 assembled a fleet of about 90 tankers, 90% of which transported russian oil/oil products from the Baltic and Black Sea ports of russia to India, China, Turkey, the Middle East, Africa and South America. In less than a year, the $2 billion fleet of oil tankers assembled by Fractal and Gatik could transport more than 40 million barrels of oil/oil products. India, UAE - the jurisdictions of the leading shadow fleet operators Fractal Marine DMCC, Gatik Ship Management and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC, have not joined the price-cap policy and do not apply restrictions to russian oil. Fractal Marine DMCC, Gatik Ship Management and Radiating World Shipping Services LLC in the tanker market helped russian oil to continue circulating around the world and the russian government to provide multibillion-dollar revenues bypassing the sanctions. After Fractal Marine was sanctioned, DMCC tried to challenge the sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom but lost in court. After that, the company 're-signed' its fleet to other companies established, in particular, in the UAE. Thus, the UAE-based Aizdihar Ship Charter FZCO took over 2 tankers that had previously been managed by Fractal Marine DMCC - IMO 9400980 and IMO 9417464. These vessels, managed by Aizdihar Ship Charter FZCO, continue to export russian oil/oil products from russian ports in the Baltic Sea.\r\nThe shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the kremlin bypassing sanctions, poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers."

The international NGO Greenpeace considers the tanker to be part of the shadow fleet.\r\nThe owner and commercial manager of the vessel is an unknown company, Strategic Alliance Ltd, registered in the Marshall Islands at: Trust Company Complex, Ajeltake Road, Ajeltake, Majuro MH 96960. This address in the Marshall Islands is identical for a whole group of oil tanker owners/managers, which may indicate an offshore zone for the shadow fleet operator network. In April 2024, more than 70 oil tanker owners/managers were registered at the address in the Marshall Islands. Under this model, only one tanker is registered per company, and in many cases the name of the shipowning company coincides with the name of the vessel owned by that company. All such tankers carried out transportation without IG P&I insurance, and 46 companies transported Russian oil without IG P&I insurance. \r\nAgainst the backdrop of sanctions, russia is using a scheme of 'juggling' ships between related companies to conceal oil exports outside the price cap and other restrictions, as well as to hide the real owners of ships, and to ensure unimpeded transportation of fossil fuels by a 'shadow' fleet of outdated oil tankers, creates new companies for these purposes (in the UAE, Hong Kong, India, Turkey, Mauritius, Seychelles, and other jurisdictions) with non-transparent organizational and ownership structures. In order to implement this scheme, technical/commercial management and ship owners are constantly changing, and vessels are renamed with a change of flag, MMSI, call-sign, including for sanctioned vessels. Shadow fleet vessels operate under 'convenient flags', which allows them to conceal their true origin and avoid control by international organizations and insurance companies.\r\nAlmost all vessels involved in the transportation of russian oil by the shadow fleet since 2022 have been certified by the Indian regulator Indian Register of Shipping (IACS). The certification of shadow fleet vessels allows the shipowner/operator to insure the vessels, which, in turn, allows the vessels to enter ports and pass through various specific sea routes (straits, canals, etc.).\r\nThe 'shadow' fleet, transporting huge volumes of crude oil through heavily trafficked routes through narrow straits near the coastline, without proper P&I insurance, with the automatic identification system turned off, threatens an environmental disaster with significant economic costs to be borne by the affected coastal countries and/or the international community.\r\nOil exports from russia are the most important source of income for the kremlin regime to finance its war against Ukraine. The tax on oil production collected by russia in 2023 amounted to 8.9 trillion rubles, or 31% of total federal revenues. According to CREA data for September 2024, russia's revenues from crude oil exported by sea amounted to 192 million euros per day, 86% of the total volume of russian marine crude oil was transported by \"shadow\" tankers, while tankers owned or insured in countries that impose price restrictions accounted for 14% of the total value of russian oil exported in September.\r\nThus, russia's 'shadow fleet' continues to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the Kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners, and poses significant environmental threats with significant economic costs to coastal countries and/or the international community due to the outdated and inadequate insurance of shadow fleet tankers."
