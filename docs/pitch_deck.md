Solution
Real-time tracking of the most notorious vessels in the world
Alerting when something unusual is happening nearby critical infrastructure
Connecting real time insights with response - we can send drones or satellites to gather more info or ask navy for help or something else..
Polish solution with a huge potential for development and expansion

Market needs
Polish strategic companies (e.g PKN Orlen, Baltic Power)
Polish armed forces and agencies
Telecommunication companies
Offshore mining and energy production companies
All Baltic states because currently only companies from US, Israel and UK handle (+/-) this problem and it’s not the best situation in the current international settings

Roadmap
Introduce AI anomaly detection
Introduce advanced alerting
Extend to other regions e.g North Sea
Extend more data sources
Connect with companies like IgEye and/or Statim about using satellites
Connect with WB Electronics or/and FlyFocus about using drones
Create a fully-fledged maritime detection and threat response platform

Tech stuff
Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
Python for scrapping
Github Pages for hosting
Vessels and infrastructure data come from Ukrainian Military Intelligence, Datalastic.com API and other OSINT sources
Maps come from Mapbox
Claude Code for putting everything together

Builder
I know a bit of programming, a bit of UX, a bit of research
So I’m a product manager, 6 years in tech
Into building 0 -> 1
Into OSINT, political and defence stuff
Into many sports
